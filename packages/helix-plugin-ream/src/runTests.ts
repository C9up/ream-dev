 * to be re-imported in each worker, so the runner needs the module's PATH, not
 * just the object it exported. `runTests` takes it as `configModule`, and
 * REFUSES to run when a suite declares a callback it was given no way to
 * deliver — in Japa a declared `configure` runs, so a run that skipped it would
 * be green in a state its own config does not describe.
